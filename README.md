# Vendor-Rejection-Analysis

Please Note: I have generated a dummy data using AI tools to perform Vendor Rejection Analysis.

KPIâ€™s:
1.	Which vendors have the highest rejection rates?
2.	What percentage of products pass QC tests?
3.	Which vendors are consistently failing QC or delivering low-quality products?
4.	How do rejection rates vary by product category?
5.	What was the rejection reason for the product from the vendors and did it pass the QC test?
6.	What are the most common reasons for product rejections?
7.	What is the trend in rejection rates over time?
